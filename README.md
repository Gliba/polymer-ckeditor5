# polymer-ckeditor5

Polymer ckeditor5 textarea component

CKeditor currently does not work in polymer becuase it is not aware of the shadow dom - see https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/issues/692
This repo is a testground for working with ckeditor. 

## Setup

Run the following commands to setup the demonstrations:

```
npm install
bower install
```

## Polymer widget demo

This demo uses the ckeditor5 classic build and provides ckeditor as a global via a script include:

```
<script src="../../node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic/build/ckeditor.js"></script>

```

To demonstrate polymer with ckeditor5, I made a work-around to get it to render by breaking out the css into a separate file. 
This component uses dist/styles.css to provide css for the component. It is generated by webpack (see below).

```
<link rel="import" type="css" href="dist/styles.css">
```

Run `polymer serve` and view the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/index.html

You'll see that the ckeditor widget 

## Usage

```html
  <polymer-ckeditor5 value="<h3>Test</h3>"></polymer-ckeditor5>
```

## Development

There is a testing ground for running ckeditor5 sourcecode as a framework for testing out ckeditor components. 
These instructions follow https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/quick-start.html

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run polymer server 
to launch the page that demonstrates ckeditor running outside polymer

```
$ polymer serve
```

View the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/index-build.html

The application code for this demo is in app.js. If you modify it, you must run the `npm run build` target to generate dist/bundle.js

There is also commented out webpack.config.js code that can be used to generate the separate dist/styles.css, which is used by the current polymer demo. 
The [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) creates the separate styles.css

```
        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract( {
          fallback: 'style-loader',
          use: [
            {
              loader: 'css-loader',
              options: {
                minimize: true
              }
            },
            'sass-loader'
          ]
        } )
 ```
